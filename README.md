# S-P-500-closing-behaviour
A hedging strategy based on the prediction of the S&P 500 closing behaviour
In order to protect themselves from the impacts of the S&P 500 movement after the european close (5:30 pm Paris time), managers can set up a hedging strategy that deals with S&P 500 futures after 5:30 pm and cuts these positions at the close  (10 pm). 

Thus, an anticipation of the autocorrelation of the S&P500's performance 10 minutes after the European close in order to set up an optimal hedging strategy.
